$ yarn setup
$ yarn start
```
Also add the FontAwesome Library (http://fontawesome.io/) inside of the vendor folder at 'client/public/vendor'

### Running the Tests

There is a basic test framework in your `test/` folder. Here's how to use it:

```bash
$ yarn test                 # runs all tests
$ yarn test server/index.js # runs tests in a single file
```

## Made with Concatapult
